What means Mindsphere support?
------------------------------

- added config.mdsp.js to support mindsphere's mongo32 backing service out-of-box
- added csrf token handling to all form and ajax request

After cf push, bind your mongo32 instance to the app and register the app with developer cockpit (create and manage permissions as well)

Rest of the README is available in the original project:
